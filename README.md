1- Churn Analysis:
Analyse the data and bring out few insights on the customer Churn.
It is advantageous for companies to know what leads a client towards the decision to leave the company.

Churn prevention allows companies to develop loyalty programs and retention campaigns to keep as many customers as possible.

In this Power BI case study, I investigated a dataset from an example telecom company called Databel and analyze their churn rates.
This case study helps to understand why customers are churning at the rate they are, and how to reduce churn.
